# Good Housing Deals

Good Housing Deals is a data-driven platform that helps users evaluate real estate listings for value and potential. It uses Python to analyze housing data, Playwright for web scraping, FastAPI for the backend, and UV for virtual environment.

## Features

- Scrapes Data by city, and state
- Averages prices by city and state
- Uses Computer Vision to determine whether the interior is modern or not
- Provides a user-friendly interface for evaluating listings and whether they are above market or below market value
- See all listings on a country map
- Filter by price, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, and square footage or good deal score

## Why did I build this?

I built Good Housing Deals to help people make informed decisions when buying real estate. The housing market can be complex and overwhelming, and I wanted to create a tool that simplifies the process of evaluating listings. By leveraging data analysis and computer vision, I aimed to provide users with insights that go beyond just the listing price, helping them find properties that offer true value.
