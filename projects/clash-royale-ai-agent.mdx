# Clash Royale A.I Agent

The Clash Royale A.I Agent is an intelligent automation system designed to enhance gameplay in the popular mobile game Clash Royale. Using computer vision and machine learning, this agent can analyze game states, make strategic decisions, and execute actions autonomously, helping players improve their performance.

## Capabilities

- **Real-Time Analysis**: Processes game screenshots to identify cards, elixir levels, and opponent positions.
- **Strategic Decision Making**: Uses TensorFlow models to predict optimal card plays.
- **Automated Actions**: Simulates touch inputs on Android devices for seamless integration.
- **Performance Tracking**: Logs game data for analysis and improvement.

## Technical Implementation

Built with cutting-edge AI technologies:

- **Computer Vision**: OpenCV for image processing and object detection.
- **Machine Learning**: TensorFlow for predictive modeling and decision trees.
- **Data Analysis**: Pandas for processing game statistics and performance metrics.
- **Mobile Integration**: Android automation framework for device control.

This project showcases the potential of AI in gaming, demonstrating how machine learning can be applied to complex, real-time strategy games. While created for educational purposes, it highlights the intersection of AI research and mobile gaming automation.
