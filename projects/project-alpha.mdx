# Project Alpha

Project Alpha is an imaginary demo project used to show how project content
can be stored as MDX and dynamically imported at runtime. It includes a short
description and a few example sections.

## Goals

- Demonstrate MDX-driven project pages
- Keep metadata close to content

Built with love.
