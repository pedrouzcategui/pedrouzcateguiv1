Sometimes, you want to apply for jobs, but you do not have the time to edit your CV to tailor it for specific companies.

## Features

- Introduce your professional profile data, or have it extracted by uploading your main CV
- Automatically apply to multiple jobs on LinkedIn based on your job title or position
- Edit the generated CVs on the fly
- Perform a "Job Search" and have them stored in a queue for you to review them later

## Why did I build this?

I wanted to change jobs, I have so many skills, that they do not fit in the actual CV, so instead of generating one CV, I wanted to send tailored CVs to companies that required my skillset.
