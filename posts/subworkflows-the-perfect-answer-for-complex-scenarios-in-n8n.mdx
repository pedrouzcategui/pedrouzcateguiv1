_When your n8n workflow starts looking like a bowl of spaghetti, it's time to introduce subworkflows._

Subworkflows are a powerful feature in n8n that allow you to call one workflow from another. This is similar to calling a function in programming.

## Why use subworkflows?

There are several reasons why you might want to use subworkflows:

1. **Reusability**: If you have a sequence of nodes that you use in multiple workflows, you can put them in a subworkflow and call it from wherever you need it.
2. **Maintainability**: Breaking a large workflow into smaller subworkflows makes it easier to understand and maintain.
3. **Error Handling**: You can handle errors in a subworkflow without failing the parent workflow.

## How to create a subworkflow

Creating a subworkflow is easy. Just create a new workflow and add an **Execute Workflow Trigger** node. This node will receive the data passed from the parent workflow.

Then, add the nodes that perform the desired task. Finally, you can optionally add an **Execute Workflow** node at the end to return data back to the parent workflow.

## Calling a subworkflow

To call a subworkflow from another workflow, use the **Execute Workflow** node. You can select the subworkflow you want to call and pass data to it.

## Example scenario

Imagine you have a workflow that processes incoming emails. You might want to extract the attachments, save them to cloud storage, and then send a notification to a Slack channel.

Instead of putting all these nodes in a single workflow, you could create a subworkflow for saving attachments and another for sending notifications. This would make your main workflow much cleaner and easier to understand.

## Conclusion

Subworkflows are an essential tool for building complex automations in n8n. By breaking your workflows into smaller, reusable pieces, you can make them more maintainable, robust, and easier to understand.
