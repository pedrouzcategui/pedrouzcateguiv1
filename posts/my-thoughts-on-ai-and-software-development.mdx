First of all, everything that I say, I mean it.

I think that software development (please read carefully) is changing.

The ability to read code is still relevant.
The ability to write code is dead.

A.I is effectively a great predictor, however, it doesn't "think" by itself.

So A.I won't be taking your job, just someone who uses A.I more effectively will do that.

We are in the game of leverage, and we need to use all of the skills we can in order to survive.

A.I is just a new expectation around how fast software is produced.

Before, it took an extraordinary amount of time to do that because you needed developers in certain technologies to do stuff.

Now, you have a tool that allows you to learn faster and write code faster too. But our thinking speed is equally the same.
