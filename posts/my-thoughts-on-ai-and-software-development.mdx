Software development (please read carefully) is changing.

The ability to read code is still relevant, even more relevant than ever.
The ability to write code is dead.

A.I won't be taking your job, just someone who uses A.I more effectively will do that.

A.I is just a new expectation around how fast software is produced.

Before, it took an extraordinary amount of time to do that because you needed developers in certain technologies to do stuff.

Now, you have a tool that allows anyone to generate software, without even understanding the entire thing.

## Skills that are not going away

### Math, Physics, Statistics and Logical Argumentation

All domains, my prediction is that people who focuses exclusively on these areas, will produce better output using the same A.I tools than those who not.

### Linux (more than ever!) and GNU Licensed Software

Linux is just THE best operating system for anything related to A.I, I really wish that (together) we can develop an GNU licensed tool to do video animation and make animation a tool that everyone can use.

### Animations and Remarkable Design

Yes, A.I can create decent looking websites, but there is still a lot to be done in regards of animations, remarkable design, and creativity. Web Development will have a subset of a more of an artisan approach (check neocities, this movement is already happening)

### First Principles Thinking

Learning how to think is crucial for this new era, more than skills, thinking is really what makes the difference.

### Low Level Programming

This one is a bit difficult, because it is certainly going to be replaced at some point, however, I think there is just a lot of things that are going to be re-written in more memory-safe languages such as _Rust_, that we will need people who know how to use it.

### Marketing, Analytics, Sales

Marketing will be automated, but I think Analytics is one of those areas where companies do not care about what is happening in the short term, and then realize that they need analytics to understand what decisions to make. I think high ticket sales is one of those areas where humans are still needed, not sure how many people will be comfortable giving more than 50K blindly through a stripe checkout page. I think chatbot agents are definitely getting better, I bought insurance through a bot agent that was very well informed to make the sell.
