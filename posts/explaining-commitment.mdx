I was on a wedding yesterday. It was very cool!

However, I was talking to a friend, and we were discussing about our 2026 goals.

Part of the goals for this upcoming year, are the fact that I:

1. Want to make more money
2. Want to become an A.I Engineer and DevOps Engineer
3. Want to participate (and win if possible) a crossfit competition, as well as have a more active lifestyle (swimming, running, biking, hiking, etc.)
4. Fix my acne-skin, teeth, and get muscular/leaner

Now, I was on the wedding, I was on an positive environment, we were dressed up, drinking, celebrating, good music, good people, etc. It is easy to think that you will do these things without any issues, without thinking that they will be hard at all. You visualize yourself doing the things and already with the results.

However, I woke up the day after the wedding and go to eat junk food.

Now, this lead me to think that _is easy to commit when pressure is low_.

I did not have any type of pressure on the wedding to commit to the things that I said I wanted to do, however, the days after that, when you don't necessarily feel good to go, those are the days that truly matter. To quote a YouTuber that I saw some years ago: **Do the hard work, specially when you don't feel like it.**

So basically, this is just a reminder for me and (hopefully) the readers of this post, to understand what you are saying yes to and committing to, and to remember that commitment is an every second practice. You can choose to keep going and keep commited, or to break the contract.
