I got awarded with the _Magna Cum Laude_ honorific mention when I did graduate from my associate degree in computer science.

It really doesn't mean shit. Do not get me wrong, it was great the first 2 days, then I realized that it really doesn't mean shit.

I want to know more, I want to solve more complex problems, I want to become better at coding, infra, etc.

Magna Cum Laude only shows that you are able to do good work consistently, and that you can learn. But it doesn't demonstrate intelligence.

Also, I learned that doing the boring work is mandatory, there is no such thing as glorious training.

Training is and should be boring, and focused. That's how it is.

## BORING IS GOOD PEOPLE!
